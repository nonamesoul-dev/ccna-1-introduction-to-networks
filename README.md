## CCNA 1 – Introduction to Networks

Real-world skill developed in this repository:

👉 Understand and troubleshoot basic networks, as performed by a junior network technician in real environments.

---

### What you can DO in practice

- Understand why a network works or does not work (not just memorizing the OSI model).
- Identify which layer is failing (physical, network, transport, service).
- Detect common issues such as:
  - Incorrect IP address
  - Misconfigured default gateway
  - DNS resolution failures
  - Physical connectivity or cabling problems
- Use basic diagnostic commands:
  - `ping`
  - `ipconfig` / `ifconfig`
  - `tracert` / `traceroute`
- Read and understand simple network topologies without losing context.

### Where this is used in real life

- Technical support
- Help desk
- NOC (Network Operations Center) junior roles
- SOC (Security Operations Center) junior triage
- Entry-level cloud and networking roles

---

### KEY skill

👉 Think in layers and communication flow, not “trial and error”.
